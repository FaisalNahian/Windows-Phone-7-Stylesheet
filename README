First of all, I am not an experienced programmer in whatever 
languages. However, I love WP7 UI when I saw it in the first time.

So I search around and hope finding a stylesheet about WP7, and what I 
finally found is https://github.com/paulmwatson/browsertiles This 
Project (by Paul M. Watson). I forgot where lead me there, but it is 
what I want. 

I find it interesting, and read the CSS to learn how to do it. 
And the fastest way to understand is try it myself. 

That's why I am creating this. And of course thanks https://github.com/paulmwatson Mr. Watson's project.
