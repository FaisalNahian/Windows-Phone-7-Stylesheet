First of all, I am not a experienced programmer in whatever
            languages.<br />
            However, I love WP7 UI when I saw it in the first time<br 
/><br />
            So I search around and hope finding a stylesheet about WP7, 
and what
            I finally found is <a href=
            "https://github.com/paulmwatson/browsertiles">This Project 
(by Paul
            M. Watson)</a>. I forgot where lead me there, but it is what 
I
            want.<br />
            I find it interesting, and read the CSS to learn how to do 
it.<br />
            <br />And the fastest way to understand is try it myself. 
That's why
            I am creating this. And of course thanks <a href=
            "https://github.com/paulmwatson">Mr. Watson</a>'s project.
